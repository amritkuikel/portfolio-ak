/**
 * The upload flow (docs/decisions.md 0098):
 *
 * 1. signUpload: the browser asks for a signature for one upload; the server
 *    picks the public_id (so the browser can only write that one slot) and
 *    restricts formats (Cloudinary enforces the signed allowed_formats).
 * 2. The browser uploads the file straight to Cloudinary.
 * 3. confirmUpload: the server reads the asset back with the Admin API, checks
 *    format and size against the rules (Cloudinary has no size limit for signed
 *    uploads, so it's enforced here: a too-large file is deleted again) and
 *    records it as a pending attachment owned by the uploader.
 * 4. The entity's own save links pending attachments (repository.syncEntityAttachments).
 *
 * Removed and orphaned assets are deleted by `cleanup` (scheduled) and, right
 * away when possible, by `purge`.
