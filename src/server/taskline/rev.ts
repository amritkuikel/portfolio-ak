 * A project's `rev` and the rows' `version`s (docs/guides/taskline.md, "Concurrency").
 *
 * - `rev` goes up with every change to a project or its tasks, in the change's
 *   transaction: open pages poll it and refetch when it moved (Task 48).
 * - `version` goes up only when a form saves (a task's title and description, the
 *   project form, the settings): a save from an older version is refused as stale.
 *   Single-field changes (status, assignee, dates…) are last-write-wins and leave
 *   the version alone, so moving a card never makes someone's open description stale.
 *
 * `rev` and `task_seq` keep `updated_at` as it was (Drizzle's `$onUpdate` would move it):
 * they are bookkeeping, not an edit of the project.
