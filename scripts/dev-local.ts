/**
 * pnpm dev:local: the dev server on a local database that keeps its data
 * (decision 0155). Every query is a local call instead of a round trip to a
 * remote Neon database, which is what makes `pnpm dev` feel slow from far away.
 *
 * - Database: PGlite in .data/pglite (scripts/lib/local-db.ts), on
 *   127.0.0.1:LOCAL_DB_PORT (default 54320). New migrations are applied on every
 *   start; the first start also seeds an admin and the demo data.
 * - Everything else (email, Sentry, PostHog, Cloudinary…) comes from .env, as
 *   with `pnpm dev`. For no outside services at all, use `pnpm dev:offline`.
