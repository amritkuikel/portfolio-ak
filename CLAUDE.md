# CLAUDE.md

Entry point for working on this repository (people and AI sessions alike). Read this first, then the guide for the area you touch. It holds only what most tasks need; the rest is in the guides (0223).

## What this is

A bilingual (English + Nepali) portfolio app with a public site and an admin area. Every page renders on the server, works in both locales, and passes strict CSP, accessibility and layout-shift checks. **Test CRUD** is the reference feature to copy.

- **Plan and status:** [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md). **Never read it whole:** search it, or read only the lines you need. Part 5 (section 11, Tasks 46–58: **Taskline**) is done; its review and measurements are decisions 0226 and 0227. Part 6 (section 12, **Parda**) is under way: Tasks 59 to 61 are done, its look is "Masking" (0232), its frame and media kit are 0233, and its servers are a placeholder that plays no video until the owner connects a provider (0228). Other work follows the same rules: read the guide for the area, run every gate, and record non-obvious choices.
- **Why things are the way they are:** [docs/decisions.md](docs/decisions.md), numbered with an index. Add an entry for every non-obvious choice.
- **Taskline** (Part 5) is a product of its own at `/app/taskline` (0208): its routes in `src/routes/_taskline`, its pages and shell in `src/features/taskline`, its tables, access resolver and services in `src/server/taskline`, its functions in `src/functions/taskline`; the admin runs the team from `/admin/taskline` (`src/features/taskline/admin`, `src/server/taskline/admin`, `src/functions/taskline-admin`) ([taskline.md](docs/guides/taskline.md)). <!-- @taskline -->
- **Where things are:** the portfolio is the site at `/`; the showcase apps are under `/apps` (Notes, Links, Expenses, Habits and Forms; Kanban became Taskline, and `/apps/kanban` redirects there), open to visitors through guest sessions; Taskline is at `/app/taskline`, with a sandbox for visitors; a published form is at `/f/<slug>`. The demo and the references live under `/dev` (`pnpm dev` only, 404 in production): the demo home, `/dev/stack`, the public Test CRUD pages and `/dev/examples`, one working page per module, each naming its source file and guide.

**Stack:** TanStack Start, Router, Query, DB, Form and Store; React 19, TypeScript 6 strict; Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui; Zod 4, Paraglide; Better Auth, Drizzle + Neon Postgres (PGlite in tests); Vitest, Storybook, Biome, Knip, pnpm. Versions and services: [architecture.md](docs/guides/architecture.md).

**Code:** `src/routes` (file routes), `src/features/<name>` (one feature, client and server), `src/functions` (server functions), `src/server` (server-only), `src/components`, `src/hooks`, `src/lib` (shared), `messages/` (en, ne), `drizzle/` (migrations), `tests/`, `e2e/`, `scripts/`. The full map: [conventions.md](docs/guides/conventions.md).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm setup:local         # fresh clone -> runnable: .env, secret, messages, local database (0156)
pnpm diagnose            # checks Node, .env, database latency and migrations, ports; prints fixes
pnpm dev                 # http://localhost:3000, on DATABASE_URL from .env
pnpm dev:local           # same, on a local PGlite database in .data/pglite (fast; kept between runs, 0155)
pnpm dev:offline         # same, on in-memory PGlite with every outside service off (0149)
pnpm typecheck           # compiles messages, then tsc with a 4 GB heap (0222: the default 2 GB no longer fits)
pnpm check               # Biome lint + format check (warnings fail). pnpm check:fix to fix
pnpm knip                # unused files, exports, types and dependencies (knip.json)
pnpm test                # unit + server (PGlite) + jsdom component tests
pnpm test:storybook      # every story in real Chrome, twice: en/light and ne/dark (a11y violations fail)
pnpm test:e2e            # builds + starts a production server (PGlite, fake Resend), then flows + the browser review of every page
pnpm build               # production build (.output/); pnpm start runs it
pnpm build-storybook
pnpm db:generate | db:migrate | db:check
pnpm i18n:translate      # machine-translates Nepali for messages that have none (review the diff, 0157)
pnpm i18n:check          # missing or empty translations, variables, plural forms
pnpm new:feature <name> [--public] [--localized]   # a feature in the CRUD standard (crud.md, 0175); needs a committed tree
node scripts/check-bundle.ts   # after a build: every page's JavaScript (with what it imports) and preloaded fonts against the budget (0151, 0217)
```

Seed commands are in [deployment.md](docs/guides/deployment.md), coverage in [testing.md](docs/guides/testing.md).

A task is done when `typecheck`, `check`, `knip`, `test`, `test:storybook`, `test:e2e`, `build`, `build-storybook`, `i18n:check` and the bundle budget are all green (CI runs them on every PR) with no warnings. `test:e2e` is the browser review: every page on a production build, en/ne × light/dark × 390/768/1280 (axe, overflow, console, CSP, CLS ≤ 0.01), plus the flows.

## Golden rules

1. **Server-render everything.** The loader awaits `ensureQuery(queryClient, opts)` (`src/lib/query.ts`; Query 5.104 deprecated `ensureQueryData`, 0111) and the component calls `useSuspenseQuery(opts)`. No first-paint fetching in effects. Loaders return only what `head`/`staticData` need.
2. **Reuse before writing.** Pages are built from `src/components/page`, `data-table`, `data-display`, `charts`, `filters`, `navigation`, `dialogs` and `forms` (the kit: design-system.md, "Components"). Feature code supplies columns, filters, fields and actions. A pattern used twice becomes shared.
3. **The URL is the state** for lists (`q`, filters, `sort`, `page`, `pageSize`). These come from the shared list contract: `src/lib/list/` (params, paging, URL serialization) on both sides, plus `src/server/db/list.ts` for SQL. Filters go in `<FilterBar>`, which works without JS. List pages use `listSchema` for the contract, `listLoader` (`tableListInput` + `loadList`) in the loader and `useListPage` + `CrudListPage` in the component (0116, 0173).
4. **The server is the authority.** Every protected server function runs `requirePermission("<resource>:<action>")` (`tests/server/guarded-functions.test.ts` makes every file in `src/functions` declare its guards), validates input with the feature's Zod schema, and calls into `src/server/**`. Routes add `assertRoutePermission` in `beforeLoad`; the UI only hides (`useCan`, `<Can>`) what the server would refuse.
5. **Server-only code stays server-only:** `src/server/**` and `*.server.ts`, enforced by Start import protection and tests.
6. **i18n:** every user-visible string is a Paraglide message in `messages/en.json` and `messages/ne.json`. Call `m.key()` at render time, never in module-level constants. Delete keys whose UI is gone (a test checks).
7. **Import Zod as `"zod"`.** It resolves to `src/lib/zod.ts` (jitless). The CSP forbids eval (decision 0086). Biome refuses `zod/v4`.
8. **No `any`, no `@ts-ignore`,** and no lint suppression without a reason in the comment.
9. **Every page is indexable or private:** public content uses `seo()` (lists `listSeo()`) and goes in the sitemap; everything else is `noindex` via its layout or `privateHead()`. `tests/unit/route-seo.test.ts` checks every route (0100).
10. **Docs move with code:** update the guide for the area and `decisions.md` for non-obvious choices in the same commit. A new pitfall goes in its area's guide; it goes here only if most tasks would hit it.

**Adding a feature:** read [crud.md](docs/guides/crud.md), the only "add a feature" text (0173), and start with `pnpm new:feature <name> [--public] [--localized]` (0175).

## Pitfalls most tasks can hit

- **Windows:** keep the checkout path short, about 90 characters at most (0029). In Git Bash, avoid apostrophes inside heredocs and `node -e`, and backslashes inside `node -e` strings and heredocs (a heredoc turned a script's `\\w` into `w`); write the script file with the editor instead. In edit scripts, pass replacements to `String.replace` as functions: `$`` in a replacement string is a special pattern.
- **Server functions: `requirePermission` first, then `withServices`** (0173): the guard test's regex allows exactly that order, and a refused call builds nothing. Keep `createServerFn(…)` literal in each functions file (Start extracts them statically). Inputs are `z.strictObject`; URL search schemas never are (links carry utm tags).
- **Taskline's services resolve access first** (0204): every app function runs `requireTasklineUser` → `withTasklineServices`, and its service calls `resolveWorkspace`/`resolveProject` before reading or writing anything; a new function adds its operation to the access matrix (`tests/server/taskline-access.test.ts`). Notifications are written in the same transaction (`produce`) and their instant emails handed to `services.deliver` only after it commits (0214). A write that may fire automations hands its events to `runAutomations` at the end of its transaction (0221); the engine writes through repositories, never services, so nothing chains. <!-- @taskline -->
- **Routes stay thin:** loader, search, head and a component that renders one from `src/features/<name>/components` (0143).
- **Route options are in every page's JavaScript** (0151): only `component`, `pendingComponent`, `errorComponent` and `notFoundComponent` are split out, and only when written inline in `createFileRoute("…")({ … })` (not spread or returned by a helper). Route files import a feature's `search.ts` (URL contract), never `schema.ts` (form schemas), and a loader imports its feature's `queries.ts` (or a functions module) with `await import(…)` inside the loader: one static import puts every server-function stub of that feature in every page (0194, 0197). `node scripts/check-bundle.ts` after a build shows the cost.
- **The React Compiler memoizes client code** (0136): don't add `useMemo`/`useCallback` for speed. Keep `useMemo` where identity matters (creating a TanStack DB collection). It runs in Storybook too, not in SSR.
- **Server logs go through `log()`** (`src/server/log.ts`), not `console.*`, so each line carries the request id; the id comes from AsyncLocalStorage set by `src/server.ts` (0123). Uptime monitors use `GET /api/health`, not the `/health` page (0124).
- **Schema changes need a migration:** CI fails when `drizzle-kit generate` would produce one. There is no `db:push` (0118).
- **Shared lists carry `// @new-feature:<slot>` markers** (permissions, labels, audit actions, admin sections, commands, schema index, guard test, e2e pages, sitemap, route-SEO test): keep them when editing those lists, or `pnpm new:feature` can't insert there. Code of a removable layer in shared files sits between `portfolio:start`/`portfolio:end` (or `apps:…`) comment lines or on a line ending in `// @portfolio` (`<!-- @portfolio -->` in Markdown), for `pnpm strip-demo` (0163, 0175); `tests/unit/strip-markers.test.ts` checks they balance.
- **Knip entries:** files reached only by a string path (Nitro routes and plugins in `vite.config.ts`, Vite-plugin modules, alias targets) must be listed in `knip.json`'s `entry`, or knip reports them unused. Don't delete them on knip's word alone.
- **E2E against a stale build:** locally, `pnpm test:e2e` reuses a server already on port 3100 (`node e2e/harness/server.ts`). Restart it after changing app code, or the suite tests the old build. Auth endpoints are rate limited per IP: tests that sign in call `harness.resetRateLimits()` first.
